Example program to flash the keyboard LED on and off every second.
Run with sudo as it needs super user priviledge to access ports.

This program comes in two halves:

led.c 		main, gets ioperms() and calls assembler
flash_led.S  	assembler that does the LED flashing.

flash_led.S can be incorporated into the early linux resume code
for debug purposes, namely in arch/x86/kernel/acpi/wakeup_32.S

the assembler has been tested in wakeup_32.S for resume debug
purposes.
